1. Query string example: 
`www.example.com?query=database+tools&star_rating=4`
- Query strings start after ? and contain key-value pairs
- Multiple parameters are separated by &
- = separates each key and value

2. Escaping characters means:
- Removing/replacing characters that could behave like code
- Converting HTML reserved characters to their entity values (like < becomes &lt;)
- Prevents malicious code (XSS attacks) by treating special characters as literal text

3. HTTP Status codes (most common):
- 200: OK - Request was successful
- 400: Bad Request - Server cannot understand the request
- 401: Unauthorized - Authentication is required
- 403: Forbidden - No access rights to content
- 404: Not Found - Requested resource doesn't exist
- 500: Internal Server Error - Server encountered an error

4. Data validation is needed to:
- Ensure data is within acceptable values and right format
- Prevent malicious code injection
- Check if required fields are not empty
- Maintain data integrity and correct data types

5. Sessions and Cookies:
- Cookies: Text files stored in browser to remember user data, sent with each request to same domain
- Sessions: Store user information on server for duration of site visit
- They work together: Cookie contains session ID to access session data on server
- Help maintain user state since HTTP is stateless
